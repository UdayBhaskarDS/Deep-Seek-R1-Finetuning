Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of involuntary urine loss when she coughs or sneezes. But she doesn't leak at night. She underwent a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. The question is about what cystometry would show regarding her residual volume and detrusor contractions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means. Cystometry is a diagnostic procedure where they fill the bladder and measure how much urine is left after certain actions, like coughing. It also assesses how the detrusor muscle contracts.\n\nInvoluntary urine loss during activities like coughing suggests a possible issue with the lower urinary tract, maybe the bladder or urethra. But since she doesn't leak at night, it's more likely a daytime issue, often related to the bladder's capacity or the urethral resistance.\n\nThe Q-tip test is usually done to check for urethral obstruction. The Q-tip is a small catheter with a balloon that's passed into the urethra. When you pull it out, if the balloon doesn't empty completely, it might indicate that the urethra is blocked.\n\nSo, putting this together, the patient's symptoms point towards a possible urethral obstruction. If the Q-tip test shows that the balloon doesn't empty, that supports this diagnosis.\n\nNow, what would cystometry reveal? If the bladder is functioning normally, the residual volume after filling might be within a normal range. But if there's urethral obstruction, the detrusor muscle might have difficulty contracting, leading to an inability to empty the bladder completely, even when there's a strong detrusor contraction.\n\nWait, but in this case, the patient is experiencing involuntary loss, which might imply that the detrusor contractions aren't strong enough, or the urethral resistance is high. So, during cystometry, the detrusor contractions might be normal in terms of strength, but the ability to empty might be impaired because of the urethral obstruction.\n\nAlternatively, if the detrusor contractions are weak, the residual volume would be high. But since the patient leaks only when she coughs, it's more about the urethral resistance than the detrusor function.\n\nSo, in cystometry, the residual volume might be low or within normal limits, but the detrusor contractions might not be effective in emptying due to the urethral obstruction. Or, perhaps the detrusor contractions are normal, but the urethral resistance is high, leading to incomplete emptying.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks about residual volume and detrusor contractions. If the detrusor contractions are normal, then the issue lies elsewhere. But if the detrusor contractions are weak, the residual volume would be high. However, the patient doesn't leak at night, which suggests that her bladder capacity isn't the issue. So maybe the detrusor contractions are normal, and the problem is with urethral resistance.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Q-tip test is about urethral obstruction. If that's positive, then the issue is with the urethra. So during cystometry, when you fill the bladder and measure the residual volume, if the urethra is blocked, the detrusor contractions might be normal, but the bladder can't empty because of the obstruction. So the residual volume might be low, but the detrusor contractions are normal.\n\nWait, no. If the urethra is blocked, the detrusor contractions would still occur, but the pressure can't be transmitted to the urethra. So the bladder would still contract, but the urine can't flow out. So the residual volume would be high because the bladder can't empty. But in this case, the patient doesn't leak at night, so maybe the residual volume is low. I'm a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the detrusor contractions are weak, leading to high residual volume. But since she doesn't leak at night, her bladder capacity is normal. So perhaps the detrusor contractions are normal, and the issue is with urethral resistance.\n\nWait, the question is about what cystometry would show about residual volume and detrusor contractions. So if the detrusor contractions are normal, but the residual volume is high, it's because the detrusor can't empty. But if the urethra is blocked, the detrusor contractions might be normal, but the emptying is impaired.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the most straightforward answer. The patient has a history of involuntary loss during coughing, suggesting a possible urethral issue. The Q-tip test likely shows urethral obstruction. Therefore, in cystometry, the residual volume might be high, and the detrusor contractions might be normal, but the emptying is impaired due to the obstruction.\n\nWait, but if the detrusor contractions are normal, the residual volume should be low. I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Maybe the detrusor contractions are weak, leading to high residual volume. But since she doesn't leak at night, it's more about the urethra.\n\nI think I need to conclude that the detrusor contractions are normal, and the residual volume is within normal limits, but the ability to empty is impaired due to urethral obstruction. So the answer would be that cystometry would likely show normal detrusor contractions and a low residual volume, but impaired emptying.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, the 61-year-old woman's symptoms and the results of\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"code","source":"question = \"What is LoRA Reason on other SFT techniques , RL models are future why dont LORA works\"\n\n\nFastLanguageModel.for_inference(model) \ninputs = tokenizer([prompt_style.format(question, \"\")], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(\n    input_ids=inputs.input_ids,\n    attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask,\n    max_new_tokens=1200,\n    use_cache=True,\n)\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)\nprint(response[0].split(\"### Response:\")[1])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-31T16:27:07.149454Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-31T16:27:07.149723Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.460390Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-31T16:27:07.149701Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.459547Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what LoRA Reasoning is in the context of other SFT techniques and why RL models are considered the future, but why LoRA doesn't work. Hmm, first, I need to understand what LoRA stands for. I think it's Low-Rank Adaptation, right? So it's a technique used in machine learning where you adapt a pre-trained model by adjusting only a small part of it, keeping most of the parameters unchanged. This is supposed to save computation time and resources.\n\nNow, the question mentions \"LoRA Reason on other SFT techniques.\" SFT probably stands for Sparse Fine Tuning. So, LoRA Reason is a specific application or variant of LoRA used in SFT. I'm not entirely sure how that works, but I think it's about efficiently fine-tuning models without using too much data or computational power.\n\nNext, the question brings up RL models as the future. RL stands for Reinforcement Learning, which is a type of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by performing tasks and receiving rewards. RL models are often seen as the future because they can handle complex tasks like game playing and autonomous vehicle navigation more effectively than traditional methods.\n\nSo, why isn't LoRA working as the future? Maybe because while LoRA is great for fine-tuning and saving resources, it doesn't scale as well as RL models when it comes to truly complex, dynamic tasks. RL models can handle sequential decision-making and adapt to changing environments in ways that traditional methods might struggle with.\n\nI also wonder about the limitations of LoRA. Since it only adjusts a small part of the model, it might not capture all the necessary changes needed for more complex tasks. In contrast, RL models can build up their knowledge from scratch or use large amounts of data to train, making them more robust and adaptable.\n\nAdditionally, computational constraints might play a role. RL models can be computationally intensive, but they might offer better performance in the long run, even if it requires more resources upfront. So, while LoRA is useful for certain applications, RL models might be better suited for others where the complexity and adaptability are higher priorities.\n\nI should also consider the types of tasks where LoRA might excel. For example, in scenarios where the model doesn't need to learn entirely from scratch and can leverage existing knowledge efficiently, LoRA could be more resource-friendly. However, for tasks that require extensive sequential decision-making or dealing with uncertain environments, RL models might be more effective.\n\nIn summary, the reason RL models are considered the future is their ability to handle complex, dynamic tasks through sequential decision-making and adaptability. LoRA, while efficient for fine-tuning, doesn't scale as well to these complex scenarios, making RL models a more promising approach for the future.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique used in machine learning to efficiently fine-tune pre-trained models by adjusting only a small subset of parameters, conserving computation and resources. When applied to Sparse Fine Tuning (SFT) techniques, LoRA Reason refers to this specific application, which is effective for certain tasks but has limitations in scaling to more complex, dynamic scenarios.\n\n**Reason RL Models are the Future:**\n\n1. **Complexity and Dynamic Adaptability:** RL models excel in handling complex, dynamic tasks through sequential decision-making and adaptability, making them suitable for tasks like game playing and autonomous vehicle navigation.\n\n2. **Robust Knowledge Building:** Unlike LoRA, which relies on pre-trained models, RL models can learn from scratch or use large datasets, providing more robust and adaptable solutions.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency vs. Performance:** While RL models can be computationally intensive, they often offer better performance in the long run, especially in scenarios requiring extensive adaptability and complexity.\n\n**Limitations of LoRA:**\n\n- **Scaling Issues:** LoRA's reliance on pre-trained models and adjustment of a small subset limits its ability to handle complex, sequential decision-making tasks.\n- **Resource Efficiency:** While LoRA saves resources, it may not be suitable for tasks requiring extensive learning from scratch or dealing with uncertain environments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRL models are considered the future due to their superior handling of complex, dynamic tasks. LoRA, while efficient for fine-tuning, does not scale as well to these complex scenarios, making RL models a more promising approach for future applications.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. \nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request. \nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning. \nPlease answer the following medical question. \n\n### Question:\n{}\n\n### Response:\n<think>\n{}\n</think>\n{}\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.461195Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.461469Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.465867Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.461445Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.464941Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"code","source":"EOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token  # Must add EOS_TOKEN\n\n\ndef formatting_prompts_func(examples):\n    inputs = examples[\"Question\"]\n    cots = examples[\"Complex_CoT\"]\n    outputs = examples[\"Response\"]\n    texts = []\n    for input, cot, output in zip(inputs, cots, outputs):\n        text = train_prompt_style.format(input, cot, output) + EOS_TOKEN\n        texts.append(text)\n    return {\n        \"text\": texts,\n    }","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.466716Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.467012Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.485619Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.466978Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.484739Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from datasets import load_dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT\",\"en\", split = \"train[0:500]\",trust_remote_code=True)\ndataset = dataset.map(formatting_prompts_func, batched = True,)\ndataset[\"text\"][0]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.487209Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.487430Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-31T16:28:09.077137Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-31T16:28:04.487411Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-31T16:28:09.076437Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"README.md:   0%|          | 0.00/1.25k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"2f940a9d7d594cff81d47853e512215c"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"medical_o1_sft.json:   0%|          | 0.00/74.1M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"8bbea22b0d954163b23510568468f26b"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/25371 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"1a27c927bdf240b3abdf43105af4b435"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map:   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"fb4e149a7663480b9608425dcb8bc9bc"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":19,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. \\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request. \\nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\\n\\n### Instruction:\\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning. \\nPlease answer the following medical question. \\n\\n### Question:\\nA 61-year-old woman with a long history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing but no leakage at night undergoes a gynecological exam and Q-tip test.

There's a 61-year-old woman here who's been dealing with involuntary urine leakages whenever she's doing something that ups her abdominal pressure like coughing or sneezing. This sounds a lot like stress urinary incontinence to me. Now, it's interesting that she doesn't have any issues at night; she isn't experiencing leakage while sleeping. This likely means her bladder's ability to hold urine is fine when she isn't under physical stress. Hmm, that's a clue that we're dealing with something related to pressure rather than a bladder muscle problem. \\n\\nThe fact that she underwent a Q-tip test is intriguing too. This test is usually done to assess urethral mobility. In stress incontinence, a Q-tip might move significantly, showing urethral hypermobility.

So, that's aligning well with stress incontinence.\\n\\nNow, let's think about what would happen during cystometry. Since stress incontinence isn't usually about sudden bladder contractions, I wouldn't expect to see involuntary detrusor contractions during this test. Her bladder isn't spasming or anything; it's more about the support structure failing under stress.
